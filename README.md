# AI-Based-Exam-Proctoring-System-Basic-Model
This project develops an offline automated exam proctoring system using computer vision. Recorded exam videos are analyzed to detect candidate presence and head movements. Face detection and head pose estimation identify suspicious behavior, which is logged with timestamps and screenshots for post-exam review.
